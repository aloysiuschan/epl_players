# epl_players
The Jupyter notebook contains code to predict market values of EPL players from the 2017-2018 season, using data on player characteristics and FPL (Fantasy Premier League) statistics. I explore the use of two machine learning models: random forest and LASSO regression. Prior to running the LASSO regression, I log-transform the features where appropriate.

The dataset is obtained from https://www.kaggle.com/mauryashubham/english-premier-league-players-dataset, and contains information on EPL (English Premier League) players from the 2017-2018 season.
